**what currently exists?**
A comprehensive frontend prototype for the BIM Talent Hub platform has been developed. The application features a Behance-inspired dark theme on the homepage and a light, glassmorphism theme on internal pages. It includes multiple functional pages: Homepage, Find Jobs, Find Talent, Pricing, and detailed views for individual profiles, company profiles, projects, and jobs. Stripe has been integrated for payments (both frontend and backend), and Google Maps is integrated into the company detail page. The application is responsive and uses mock data for all content.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was fixing a critical bug where the newly redesigned homepage () was appearing blank. The user had requested a redesign to a dark, Behance-inspired theme, which introduced syntax errors.
*   **Status**: IN PROGRESS (The fix is implemented, but user has not verified it)
*   **Agent Testing Done**: Y (Agent confirmed the fix by successfully building the project and taking a screenshot showing the homepage now renders correctly.)
*   **Which testing method agent to use?**: manual testing by curl
*   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1**: Homepage rendering after major redesign (Priority: P0)

**Issues Detail**:
*   **Issue 1: Homepage rendering after major redesign**
    *   **Attempted fixes**: The agent identified and corrected a syntax error (a missing closing brace ) in a  statement within . The project now builds successfully, and screenshots confirm the UI is no longer blank.
    *   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Present the fixed homepage to the user for verification.
        2.  Run the frontend testing agent to ensure all interactive elements on the redesigned homepage (search tabs, buttons, links) are fully functional.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This fixes a critical bug that made the application's entry point unusable. The fix implements the user's requested dark, Behance-inspired design for the homepage.
    *   **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    *   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
    *   **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
There are no other tasks actively in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    *   **P0: Implement Full HR Dashboard Functionality**: The current dashboard is basic. Implement the Feasibility Analysis section with detailed candidate breakdowns and visual comparison charts as requested. (Files: )
    *   **P1: Link Stripe Subscription to User Accounts**: The Stripe checkout flow is built, but the subscription status needs to be linked to a user's account (e.g., Emergent OAuth). This involves creating a user dashboard to manage subscriptions. (Files: , )
*   **Future Tasks**:
    *   **P2: Expand Bilingual (Thai/English) Support**: The language context is set up, but translations need to be applied across all components and pages, not just the hero text. A more robust i18n library could be considered.
    *   **P2: Replace Placeholder API Keys**: Replace placeholder keys for Stripe and Google Maps with instructions for the user to add their own production keys in the  files.

**Completed work in this session**
*   **Application Scaffolding**: Created the complete React frontend structure.
*   **Core Pages Implementation**:
    - Homepage (redesigned with a dark, Behance-inspired theme).
    - Find Talent, Find Jobs, Companies pages.
    - Login/Signup pages with mock authentication flow.
    - HR Dashboard (basic version).
*   **Detailed View Pages**:
    - : For individual BIM professionals.
    - : For detailed BIM project showcases.
    - : For company profiles.
    - : For individual job postings with an application form.
*   **Stripe Payment Integration**:
    - Added backend endpoints in  to handle checkout sessions.
    - Created a  page with monthly/annual plans.
*   **Google Maps Integration**:
    - Added an interactive map to the  page.
    - Created a multi-location map component () and documentation, though it was later removed from the homepage per user request.
*   **Bug Fixes**:
    - Installed missing dependencies (, , etc.).
    - Resolved multiple rendering issues caused by component import errors and syntax errors.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. The agent has addressed all issues raised by the user or discovered during development. Pending work is classified under Upcoming Tasks.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
-   **Backend**: Python FastAPI
-   **UI/Design**: Glassmorphism, Dark Theme, Shadcn/UI components, Behance-inspired layout
-   **APIs**: Stripe for payments, Google Maps API for location display
-   **Data**: All frontend content is driven by a mock data object.

**key DB schema**
No database is used. All data is mocked in .

**changes in tech stack**
None. The tech stack aligns with the initial setup.

**All files of reference**
-   : The main landing page, recently redesigned with a dark theme. Last file worked on.
-   : Defines the core design system, colors (HSL format), and glassmorphism effects.
-   : The FastAPI server that hosts the Stripe API endpoint.
-   : Contains the logic for creating Stripe checkout sessions.
-   : Contains all mock data for profiles, jobs, projects, etc.
-   : Integrates Google Maps and company profile links.
-   : The frontend interface for the Stripe subscription plans.
-   : Documentation for configuring the Google Maps API key.

**Areas that need refactoring**
-   **Component Cleanup**: The component  was created for the homepage but later removed. It should be deleted to avoid confusion.
-   **Internationalization (i18n)**: The current  is basic. For full bilingual support, refactoring to use a standard library like  would be more scalable.
-   **State Management**: As the application grows, using a more robust state management solution (like Redux Toolkit or Zustand) instead of just React Context might be beneficial, especially for user authentication and subscription status.

**key api endpoints**
-   ****: Creates a Stripe checkout session and returns a session ID for redirection.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   This is a **frontend-first prototype**. The backend's only role is to serve Stripe API requests. All other data is mocked.
-   The user is very engaged and provides frequent, specific feedback. Be prepared to pivot and implement new features or design changes quickly.
-   The homepage has a **dark, construction-tech theme** inspired by Behance. All other internal pages use a **light, glassmorphism theme**. Maintain this design separation.
-   Stripe and Google Maps integrations use placeholder keys found in  and hardcoded in the frontend, respectively. Do not attempt to use them for production.

    -   **Pending**: The user has not yet seen or verified the fix for the redesigned homepage. This should be the next point of interaction.

**Project Health Check:**
*   **Broken**: The homepage was broken but has been fixed by the agent. Awaiting user verification.
*   **Mocked**: Almost all application data (user profiles, jobs, companies, projects) is mocked from . User authentication is also mocked.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Stripe (Payments)** — requires User API Key (currently using placeholders).
-   **Google Maps API (Mapping)** — requires User API Key (currently using placeholders).

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES (Used once early in development).
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
-   **Test files created**: None.
-   **Known regressions**: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
No credentials are required. The application uses a mock authentication flow.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent has not yet implemented the advanced Feasibility Analysis features (visual comparison charts, detailed scoring) for the HR Dashboard, which was a key requirement.
-   The agent created the Stripe integration but did not connect the subscription status to a user's account, a crucial part of the subscription flow.
-   The bilingual support was demonstrated but not fully implemented across the application.</analysis>
